# Changelog

All notable changes to Nox API will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-03-19

### Improvements

#### Sidebar Split — AI Console + Hogwarts Portal
- **Console sidebar simplified**: Stripped to 3 clean sections — 工作台 (dashboard, tokens, logs, playground), 账户 (wallet, settings), 管理员 (channels, models, deployment, subscriptions, redemptions, users, system settings). All HP-themed gamification items removed.
- **Hogwarts Portal**: New dedicated layout (`/console/hogwarts`) with its own gold-themed sidebar for all gamification features — daily (check-in, community, ranking, titles), economy (casino, bank), magical creatures (pets, shop, inventory, gacha, fusion, adventure, arena, market), and admin tools.
- **Top bar entry**: Castle icon "霍格沃茨" button in the top bar with gold highlight when active, visible to logged-in users.
- **"返回控制台" breadcrumb**: All Hogwarts pages show a back-to-console link at the top of the content area.
- **Portal landing page**: Card-based overview at `/console/hogwarts` with all HP features organized by category (daily, economy, magical creatures, admin).
- **Route migration**: All HP routes moved from `/console/*` to `/console/hogwarts/*` (casino, pet, checkin, community, ranking, titles, and all related admin pages). ~15 page files updated.
- **Sidebar modules config**: Added `hogwarts` section to `DEFAULT_ADMIN_CONFIG` with all HP module keys. Removed deprecated `chat` section; `playground` moved to `console` section.
- **Hogwarts CSS variables**: 8 new CSS variables for the HP theme (gold/burgundy palette).

**New files**: `hogwarts-layout.jsx`, `hogwarts-sidebar.jsx`, `pages/hogwarts/portal.jsx`
**Modified files**: `sidebar.jsx`, `top-bar.jsx`, `console-layout.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `use-sidebar-modules.js`, `globals.css`, `en.json`, ~15 page files

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-19

### Improvements

#### Bank Dollar-Based API
- All bank API endpoints now accept and return amounts in **US dollars** (float64) instead of raw quota integers. Internal storage remains quota-based for consistency with the wallet system.
- Controller layer performs automatic `dollar ↔ quota` conversion at the API boundary using `QuotaPerUnit` (500,000 quota = $1).
- Frontend no longer needs `formatQuota()` division — amounts from the API are displayed directly as dollars.
- Admin pool inject/withdraw also accepts dollar amounts.

#### Premium Demand Deposit (高息活期)
- New high-yield demand account type with configurable annual rate (default 6%, vs standard 2%).
- Each user can hold one standard demand account and one premium demand account simultaneously.
- Premium accounts have separate min deposit ($1 default), max balance ($10 default), and interest rate settings.
- Hourly interest task applies the correct rate based on account type (`demand_interest` vs `premium_interest`).
- New amber-themed UI card on the bank page with dedicated deposit/withdraw dialogs.
- Admin panel: 3 new settings (`premium_demand_rate`, `min_premium_deposit`, `max_premium_balance`) + premium stats in dashboard.
- New transaction types: `premium_deposit`, `premium_withdraw`, `premium_interest`.

#### Database Migration
- `gringotts_bank_accounts` table: added `account_type` column (0=standard, 1=premium) with composite unique index `(user_id, account_type)`. Old `idx_bank_user` index auto-dropped during migration.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-03-19

### Fixes
- **Bank DB migration**: Fixed bank tables (`gringotts_bank_accounts`, `gringotts_fixed_deposits`, `gringotts_bank_transactions`) not being created on startup. Tables were only in `migrateDBFast()` (unused) but missing from `migrateDB()` (the actual migration path).
- **Bank sidebar menu**: Moved Gringotts Bank from a casino sub-page to its own standalone sidebar menu entry with a dedicated Landmark icon, making it independent from the casino.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-19

### New Features

#### Gringotts Bank (古灵阁银行)
- **Demand deposits**: Users can deposit quota into a demand account and earn hourly interest (default 2% annual rate).
- **Fixed deposits**: 3 term options (7/30/90 days) with higher interest rates (5%/8%/12% annual). Early withdrawal incurs a configurable penalty on earned interest.
- **Independent fund pool**: Admin-managed capital pool from which all interest payments are deducted. Pool depletion pauses interest payouts.
- **Hourly interest task**: Background job calculates and distributes demand interest every hour; automatically processes matured fixed deposits.
- **Admin panel**: New "Bank Management" tab in Casino admin with pool injection/withdrawal, rate configuration, deposit limits, and aggregate statistics (total deposits, interest paid, account count).
- **Transaction history**: Full audit trail of all bank operations (deposits, withdrawals, interest, admin actions).
- **Casino lobby integration**: Bank card added to the casino lobby page.
- **Log sub-category**: Bank operations display "银行" badge in the log page.

**New files**: `model/bank.go`, `service/bank.go`, `service/bank_interest_task.go`, `controller/bank.go`, `setting/operation_setting/bank_setting.go`, `web/src/pages/casino/bank.jsx`
**New tables**: `gringotts_bank_accounts`, `gringotts_fixed_deposits`, `gringotts_bank_transactions`
**New API endpoints**: 8 (6 user + 2 admin)

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-18

### Improvements

#### Rate Limit Error Clarity
- All rate limit 429 responses now return proper JSON error bodies with `"Nox API rate limit exceeded"` message, making it easy to distinguish Nox API rate limits from upstream provider rate limits.
- Default `RetryTimes` increased from 0 to 3 — upstream 429/5xx errors now automatically retry with other available channels instead of failing immediately.

#### Model Fetching Enhancement
- `FetchModels` now supports 5 response formats: standard OpenAI `{data:[{id}]}`, `{data:[{name}]}`, `{models:[{id}]}`, flat object arrays `[{id}]`, and plain string arrays `["model"]`.
- Added 15-second HTTP timeout for model fetching requests.
- Error responses now include upstream response body (up to 500 chars) for easier debugging.
- Unified parsing logic between new-channel and edit-channel model fetching endpoints.

#### Log Page Improvements
- Added "Error" and "Refund" log type filters (previously only Topup/Consume/Manage/System were shown).
- New "Content" column in the log table shows log details directly without opening the detail dialog.
- System logs now display sub-category badges based on content keywords: Check-in, Casino, Gringotts, Arena, Achievement, Security, Registration Reward, Channel.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-18

### New Features

#### Gringotts Heist (古灵阁打劫)
- **Vault system**: Gringotts vault accumulates all casino house profits (total player losses minus wins minus stolen). Displayed on casino lobby and dedicated Gringotts page.
- **3 heist types**: Invisibility Cloak sneak ($0.10, 4h cooldown, 60% base rate), Dragon ride ($0.50, 12h, 35%), Imperio curse ($2.00, 24h, 15%). Each rewards 0.1–5% of vault balance on success.
- **Dynamic success modifiers**: +5% with SSR pet, +3% with casino win streak ≥5, -5% if someone succeeded in past 24h.
- **Failure penalties**: Entrance fee forfeited + 50% chance of extra 50% penalty + 5% chance of 6h casino ban.
- **Success broadcast**: Successful heists appear in the big-win marquee across the casino.

#### Title System (称号系统)
- **16 preset titles** across 5 categories: casino (6), heist (2), pet (4), arena (3), social (1). Rarities from N to SSR with unique colors.
- **Auto-grant**: Titles automatically awarded when conditions are met — first bet, win streaks, profit milestones, heist successes, pet collection, arena victories, follower counts.
- **Equip/unequip**: Users can display one active title. Shown via `active_title_id` on the user model.
- **Collection page**: New `/console/titles` page showing all titles with owned/unowned state, category filtering, and equip controls.

#### Pet Arena (宠物对战擂台)
- **5-round battle engine**: HP = (Defense×2 + Attack)×10. Speed determines turn order. Damage reduced by defense, with 10% minimum. Crit rate up to 30% (1.5x), dodge rate up to 20%.
- **Element counter system**: courage > ambition > wisdom > loyalty > courage, +15% damage bonus.
- **Elo rating**: Initial 1000 points, dynamic gains/losses based on rating differential. Floor at 0.
- **Defend/attack**: One defender pet per user. Up to 5 attacks per day (configurable). Rewards for both attacker wins ($0.10 + 30 EXP) and defender wins ($0.04 + 20 EXP). Double rewards when challenging 200+ higher-rated opponents.
- **Win streak bonuses**: Every 5 consecutive defense wins grants an extra $0.20.
- **30-day seasons**: Top 1 gets $10 + "Arena Champion" title. Top 2-3: $4, Top 4-10: $2, Top 11-50: $1. Rating soft-reset between seasons.
- **Admin controls**: Create/end seasons and manually settle rewards.

### Improvements

#### Leaderboard Extensions
- **Casino**: 4 new ranking types — Biggest Loser (散财童子), Heist Profit (打劫大盗), Today's Hottest (今日热门), Win Streak King (连胜之王).
- **Pet**: 2 new ranking dimensions — Total Power (总战力榜), SSR Collection (SSR收藏榜).
- **Win streak tracking**: `max_win_streak` field added to `casino_daily_stats` for persistent streak records.

#### Pet System
- **Power stat**: New computed `power` field on all pets (attack + defense + speed + luck), recalculated on every stat recomputation. Used for arena matchmaking and power rankings.

### Database Changes
- 6 new tables: `gringotts_heist_records`, `titles`, `user_titles`, `pet_arena_seasons`, `pet_arena_defenders`, `pet_arena_battles`
- `users`: added `active_title_id` (int, default 0)
- `user_pets`: added `power` (int, default 0)
- `casino_daily_stats`: added `max_win_streak` (int, default 0)
- Auto-seeds: 16 default titles + first arena season on migration

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-17

### Bug Fixes

- **Weak pet dead end**: Removed frontend `isWeak` guard that incorrectly disabled Play and Clean buttons when pet was weak — the backend already allows these operations in weak state, so the previous UI created an unrecoverable dead-end. (`web/src/pages/pet/detail.jsx`)
- **Inventory item use 404**: Fixed URL mismatch — frontend called `/use-item` (hyphen) but the backend route was `/use_item` (underscore). (`web/src/pages/pet/inventory.jsx`)
- **Magic shop missing items**: `SeedPetData()` returned early when species already existed, skipping the items migration entirely. Extracted `seedPetItemsIfNeeded()` to run unconditionally on startup, ensuring v0.1.5 shop items appear on existing databases. (`model/pet.go`)
- **User profile React #310 crash**: `useMemo(sortedPets)` was called after early returns (`if (loading)` / `if (!profile)`), violating the Rules of Hooks. Moved it before all early returns. (`web/src/pages/user-profile.jsx`)

### Improvements

- **Feed dialog redesign**: Replaced the opaque "one-click feed" button with per-item quantity selectors. Each food and potion now shows `[-] N [+] [Feed xN]` controls so users know exactly what and how much will be fed. Potions are also included in the feed dialog. (`web/src/pages/pet/detail.jsx`)
- **Market dollar pricing**: The Hog's Head consignment and auction bid forms now accept dollar amounts directly (with `$` prefix), converting to internal quota on submission. Users no longer need to mentally convert token values. (`web/src/pages/pet/market.jsx`)

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### New Features

- **XP passive growth**: Pets now gain XP automatically over time (default 5 XP/hour, max 24h accumulation). Lazy-calculated on each query — no cron needed. Configurable via admin `PassiveXpPerHour` setting. (`service/pet.go`, `model/pet.go`, `setting/operation_setting/pet_setting.go`)
- **Rarity transcendence**: Two max-star (5★) same-species pets can fuse to upgrade rarity tier — N→R, R→SR, SR→SSR. Star resets to 0, level preserved (higher of two), stats recomputed with rarity multiplier (1.3x–1.4x). New "Transcend" tab in fusion page with purple-gold theme and batch support. (`POST /api/pet/transcend`, `service/pet_gacha.go`, `web/src/pages/pet/fusion.jsx`)

### Improvements

- **Adventure dispatch sorted by success rate**: Pet selection list now sorted highest success rate first, making it easier to pick the best candidate. (`web/src/pages/pet/adventure.jsx`)
- **Pet list sorted by rarity**: My Fantastic Beasts and user profile pages now sort SSR → SR → R → N, then by star desc, then level desc. (`web/src/pages/pet/index.jsx`, `web/src/pages/user-profile.jsx`)
- **Batch buttons more prominent**: One-click fusion and batch hatch buttons upgraded with gradient backgrounds, pulse animation, and shadow for better visibility. (`web/src/pages/pet/fusion.jsx`, `web/src/pages/pet/index.jsx`)
- **Star-up stat scaling increased**: Changed from flat +10%/star to progressive scaling — 1★ +15%, 2★ +35%, 3★ +60%, 4★ +100%, 5★ +150% (2.5x base). Growth feels much more rewarding now. (`service/pet.go`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Shop still showing old items**: Added upgrade migration that detects legacy items (普通饲料, etc.) and replaces them with HP-themed items on startup. Idempotent — safe to run multiple times. (`model/pet.go`)

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Harry Potter Theming

This release transforms the pet system into a fully immersive Wizarding World experience.

- **"Pet Paradise" → "Fantastic Beasts"** (神奇动物): Renamed across all UI — sidebar, page titles, descriptions, admin panels. "My Pets" → "My Fantastic Beasts", "Adventurer/Trainer" → "Wizard/Witch".
- **Wizard/Witch title selector**: Gear icon in the pet pages header lets users choose "Wizard" or "Witch" as their title, persisted in localStorage, dynamically applied everywhere via `useWizardTitle` hook.
- **Market → "The Hog's Head"** (猪头酒吧): Full rebrand — "list" → "consign", "buyer/seller" → "buyer wizard/consigning wizard", subtitle: "The most secretive trading spot in Hogsmeade".
- **Adventure missions redesigned**: 5 HP-themed missions — Forbidden Forest Patrol, Hogsmeade Expedition, Chamber of Secrets, Gringotts Vaults, Newt's Suitcase (seed data, new installs only).
- **Food & potions expanded**: 10 HP-themed items replacing the original 6 (seed data, new installs only):
  - Food: Pumpkin Juice, Bertie Bott's Beans, Chocolate Frog, Butterbeer, Treacle Tart
  - Potions: Shrinking Solution, Scouring Solution, Pepperup Potion, Skele-Gro, Felix Felicis

### New Features

- **Batch hatch**: "Hatch All" button on the creatures list page detects all ready-to-hatch eggs, shows a confirmation plan, then executes sequentially with a progress overlay.

### Bug Fixes

- **Adventure dispatch shows result immediately**: `GetDispatchHistory` was missing the lazy-completion call (`CheckAndCompleteDispatches`), so in-progress dispatches with default `success=false` appeared as "failed". Now correctly shows "In Progress" badge until the mission timer expires.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### New Features

- **One-click fusion** — Auto-select optimal fusion materials with a single tap. Picks same-species pets by lowest star rating, excluding primary/dispatched/listed pets. Users can manually exclude specific pets and restore them. (`web/src/pages/pet/fusion.jsx`)
- **Sidebar collapsible sections** — Each sidebar group can now be collapsed/expanded by clicking its header. Defaults to collapsed, with smooth 200ms height transition animation. Collapse state persisted in localStorage. (`web/src/components/layout/sidebar.jsx`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Notification badge never clears** — Opening the notification dropdown now calls the mark-all-read API and refreshes the unread count to zero, so the red badge disappears after reading. (`web/src/components/social/notification-bell.jsx`)
- **SSR gacha result invisible** — Fixed a CSS animation override where `.gacha-ssr-border`'s `animation` property clobbered the `gacha-grid-pop` opacity transition, keeping SSR cards permanently at `opacity: 0`. Now uses comma-separated composite animation. (`web/src/components/pet/gacha-animation.jsx`)
- **Channel model group list truncated** — ScrollArea Viewport now inherits the parent's `max-height` constraint via `max-h-[inherit]`, enabling proper scrolling when the model list overflows. (`web/src/components/ui/scroll-area.jsx`)
- **Channel edit forces key re-entry** — Backend now returns a masked key (e.g. `sk****abcd`) on GET and preserves the original key when the update payload sends an empty string. Frontend shows the masked key as a hint and skips key validation in edit mode. (`controller/channel.go`, `model/channel.go`, `web/src/pages/channel.jsx`)

### i18n

- Added translations for "一键融合", "没有可用的融合素材", "没有可一键融合的宠物", "已排除", "工作台" across all 7 locales (zh-CN, zh-TW, en, ja, fr, ru, vi).

### Security & Performance Fixes

- **Gacha/Fusion race conditions** — Quota deduction moved inside database transactions with `WHERE quota >= ?` atomic check, eliminating TOCTOU vulnerabilities on concurrent pulls.
- **UseItem atomicity** — Item consumption and pet stat update now wrapped in a single transaction to prevent item loss on partial failure.
